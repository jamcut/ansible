#### Ansible task file to install PowerShell Empire
# Author: @jamcut
# Overview: Install and configure Empire
# Notes:
# - Pass in the "staging_key" variable when including this file.
#   If set to "RANDOM", Empire will randomly generate a key.
# - Currently this task will not install Empire because I havent
#   found a good way of dealing with the prompts.  The "expect"
#   module does not appear to work.
