#### Ansible task file to install PowerShell Empire
# Author: @jamcut
# Overview: Install and configure Empire
# Notes:
# - Pass in the "staging_key" variable when including this file.
#   If set to "RANDOM", Empire will randomly generate a key.
# - Currently this task will not install Empire because I havent
#   found a good way of dealing with the prompts.  The "expect"
#   module does not appear to work.

- name: "Install PowerShell Empire"
  git:
    repo: "https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/Empire.git"
    dest: "{{ install_path }}Empire/"

# Until I can figure out a good way to install via Ansible...
- debug: msg="Empire successfully cloned.  You still need to manually run install.sh."
